                        Ever get frustrated that a problem in your town or neighborhood goes ages without being resolved? You might have road issues (potholes, dangerous areas), overgrown plants, or anything else that makes living where you live a little less pleasant. With Co-make you can make your voice heard on the issues you would like to see resolved in your community. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Three simple steps: <br>
                        1. Describe the problem. <br>
                        2. Other locals upvote the problem. <br>
                        3. Problems with the most upvote get prioritized by local government or HOAâ€™s to be resolved first. <br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As well as seeing real change in your community, you get rewards for being a positive community member in the form of points, freebies and local recognition.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The problem we are solving: the disintegration in the relationship between local government and the people they represent. The feeling of apathy many have towards local issues. The inability of local government to reach and listen to their constituents effectively.
