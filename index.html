          Do you ever wish you had a direct line to the members of your city government?
        </p>
        <p id = "answer">So have we!</p>
        <p>That very thought is what gave us the idea of Co-Make, a simpler way to report issues to city officials or the community at large, while simultaneously allowing other members of the community to anonymously upvote issues to emphasize how many people are effected by the issues.</p>
        <p>
          Report any issues you see in the community, or something you would like to see in community. Then all entries will be reviewed by the city during the weekly meetings, even if you're not their to push the topic.
